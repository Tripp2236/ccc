  // love = `There is no fear in Love; but perfect Love casts out fear; because fear has torment. He that has fear is not made perfect in Love. 1John 4:18. Greater Love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. John 15:13  God demonstrated His Love toward us while we where yet  sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:8 But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great Love wherewith He Loved us, even when we were dead in sins, has made us alive together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;) Ephesians 2:4 But after the kindness and Love of God, our Saviour, toward man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of salvation, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost. Titus 2:4 God so Loved the world that He gave his only born son, that whosoever believes in Him will not perish but have everlasting life. John 3:16
  // Jesus suffered and died on the cross and rose again because He loves you. He wants you to be forgiven and to come into your life; and He wants your heart to be healed of its wounds. GOD IS LOVE.   I John 4:8
  // If you will put your faith in Jesus and call on Him for forgiveness, He will hear and begin the healing work of Christ in your life.`
